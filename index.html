			<h2>BRIEF PROFILE</h2>
            <p>I am a postgraduate student majoring in  Industrial Engineering, in Department of Mechanical Engineering &amp;  Automation, Zhejiang Science and Technology University. My current research is  focused on developing models of calculating gas emission and simulating the  emission for real-world factories.I am interested in system modeling and simulation  of real situation which can simulate some specific factors, such as time,  uncertainty, emergency and risk, <em>etc</em>.  The simulation results are analyzed so that various techniques can be performed  to predict the evolution of the system. Better scheme of the system can then be  pre-determined, which enables us to optimize the existing system or design a  new one.<br /><br />
              I graduated in July 2009 with a degree  in Industrial Engineering, in Zhejiang University of Technology, Zhijiang  College. Many of my courses and research activities in the final year were in  the field of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research and closely related  to the Production Logistics. I also have motivation in System Decision-Making  Analysis and Game theory. I was introduced to a system decision-making analysis  team in which the desire to study the risk decision-making analysis prompted me  to be interested in this field.<br /><br />
